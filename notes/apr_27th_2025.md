 - [x] I'd like to have the SimpleAgent not take any arguments
 - [x] The "client" and "model" should be settable via the `setModelClient` method
 - [x] The model_client should abstract away:
   - the LLM call
   - the setting of the system prompt in the request to the LLM
   - the extraction of tool calls from the response
   - the parsing of the response into a structured object
   - this should be what is set in the setModelClient method
   - perhaps we should use Instructor to handle this
 - [x] All method calls should be snake_case, not camelCase
 - [x] All `listener` methods should accept a function that takes the current messages array and expects the listener function to be an async function that returns the updated messages array, and also a boolean that indicates if the agent should continue running - if not, the agent should return the last assistant message that was returning from the listener function call
   - example: 
     ```python
     async def example_before_tool_call_listener(messages: List[dict]) -> Tuple[List[dict], bool]:
         # do something with the messages
         return messages, True
     ```
